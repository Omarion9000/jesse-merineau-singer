                  Hi, I'm Jesse Merineau, a singer/songwriter from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Music has always been a part of who I am. At 16, with nothing but my acoustic guitar and my voice, I started performing live, pouring my heart into every song.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What began as small acoustic gigs soon led to bigger opportunities. I became the go-to opening act for touring bands passing through my city, but I knew I wanted more. So, I stepped up my game. With a full band behind me, I started headlining shows, winning Battle of the Bands, selling out local venues, and leading the biggest festival in town.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, I'm taking things even further. I'm working on my debut EP, collaborating with some incredible names in the industry, and bringing my music to a bigger stage. Every step I take is another move toward turning my dream into reality. 2018 is the year I release my music to the worldâ€”and I can't wait to share it with you.
                </p>
